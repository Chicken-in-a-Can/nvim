# Minh's Neovim Configuration

This repository contains the configurations for my customized NeoVim experience :D

## Getting Started

### Backing Up Your Configuration

Before you go ahead and clone this configuration onto your machine, it's *recommended*
for you to first backup your own NeoVim configuration. Below are a list of directories
to back up:

- `$HOME/.config/nvim/`
- `$HOME/.local/share/nvim`
- `$HOME/.cache/nvim`

For example, you'd run these commands to back up:

```sh
mv $HOME/.config/nvim $HOME/.config/nvim.bak
mv $HOME/.local/share/nvim $HOME/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv $HOME/.cache/nvim $HOME/.cache/nvim.bak
```

> Note: 'backing up' in this context just means renaming
> those directories.

### Cloning the Repository

Cloning the git repository is done with this command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/samminhch/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

### ...And you're all set!
